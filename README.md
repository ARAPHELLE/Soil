 An open-source fan-recreation of Dani's Muck in the Unity Game Engine.

Due to Dani potentially not providing updates to the base game, we thought a fan-recreation of Muck that was open-source would provide fans with the tools to keep the game, at least in spirit, alive.

If you are working on a commit for the game, just a reminder that you should put your name into the credits section!
